                    Raised in the small town of Newton Grove, North Carolina, and proud of his Guatemalan heritage, Cris is pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence. From an early age, he was captivated by computers and technologyâ€”fascinated by how something so complex could be so compact. This passion drives his aspiration to innovate in software development and build a successful career in the tech industry. Growing up in a rural community where few shared his interest in technology, he draws inspiration from his parents, whose journey as immigrants and sacrifices instilled in him the drive to seize every opportunity. He dreams of being able to repay them for all their hard work and sacrifices.
